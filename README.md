###TurtleTown 2

The goal of Turtle Town 2 is to create a city that is run entirely by turtles. One of the goals of TurtleTown is to have turtles that create more turtles, that eventually go on to create more turtles. Thus, the core of the city is dedicated to acquiring resources that are required for building turtles. The process for building turtles is:

1. 6 glass -> 16 glass panes
2. 7 stone + 1 glass pane + 1 redstone -> 1 computer
3. 3 * (log -> 4 wood planks)
4. 8 wood planks -> 1 chest
5. 1 chest + 1 computer + 7 iron -> 1 basic turtle
6. 2 wood planks -> 4 sticks
7. 2 sticks + 3 diamonds -> 1 diamond pickaxe
8. 1 diamond pickaxe + 1 basic turtle -> 1 mining turtle
9. 1 ender pearl + 8 smooth stone + 1 mining turtle -> 1 wireless mining turtle (optional)

4. Logs        - Tree farm turtle
5. Diamonds    - Miner turtle
6. Redstone    - Miner turtle
